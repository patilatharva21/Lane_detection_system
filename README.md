## Lane Detection System
This Lane Detection System is a Python-based application that uses OpenCV and the Hough Transformation technique for real-time lane detection in live video streams. The application features a simple and user-friendly GUI created with PyQt5.

## Features
- **Live Video Lane Detection:** Detects lanes in real-time from a live video feed.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with PyQt5, the GUI provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the lane detection system.
- **Efficient Lane Detection:** Utilizes Canny edge detection and Hough Transformation to accurately identify lane lines in various road conditions.
 Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used for developing the system.
- **OpenCV:** Used for image processing, including edge detection and lane detection.
- **Hough Transformation:** A technique applied for detecting straight lines (lanes) in the video feed.
- **PyQt5:** Used to create the graphical user interface for easy interaction with the system.

## Usage
The application will process each frame from the video feed and display the detected lanes on the screen.
The detected lanes will be highlighted, allowing for easy visualization.
